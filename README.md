1. Loading Libraries
You’re using three libraries:

readr: Reads CSV files into R for easy data handling.
ggplot2: A visualization library used to create high-quality, customizable plots.
broom: Cleans up and organizes model output into tidy dataframes, making results easier to analyze.
2. Loading and Verifying Data
You’re reading a dataset (study_data.csv) into R and previewing the first few rows to ensure it’s loaded correctly. This step is essential for confirming that your data is structured as expected.

3. Exploring the Data
You calculate summary statistics (like min, max, and median) for each variable and create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between "Days" and "Time Study." This helps identify trends or patterns in the data.

4. Fitting a Linear Model
You fit a simple linear regression model where "Time Study" is the dependent variable (what you’re trying to predict) and "Days" is the independent variable (predictor). This model estimates how much study time changes as the number of days increases.

5. Examining the Model
The model summary provides:

Coefficients: How "Days" affects "Time Study."
R-squared: How well the model explains the variation in "Time Study."
P-values: Whether the predictor variable ("Days") significantly affects the dependent variable.
You use the broom package to tidy the model results, making them easier to read and work with.

6. Visualizing the Regression
You create a plot with a polynomial regression curve to better fit the data. This curved line accounts for non-linear relationships between "Days" and "Time Study," making the visualization more precise.

7. Model Diagnostics
You generate diagnostic plots to check the model’s assumptions. These include:

Residual plots to ensure errors are randomly distributed.
Other plots to check for outliers or issues like heteroscedasticity (unequal error variance).
8. Making Predictions
You create a sequence of new "Days" values and predict corresponding "Time Study" values using the model. This step helps you assess how the model performs across the full range of data and provides confidence intervals for predictions.

9. Final Plot
You visualize the original data points alongside the polynomial regression curve. This allows you to clearly see the relationship between "Days" and "Time Study" and how well the curve represents the data.

10. Summarizing the Model
You calculate and display:

R-squared: A measure of how well the model fits the data.
Regression Equation: Shows the relationship between "Days" and "Time Study" as a mathematical formula.
This summary helps interpret the overall effectiveness of the model and provides insights into the behavior of the data.
